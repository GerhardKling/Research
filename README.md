# The impact of climate vulnerability on firms' cost of capital and access to finance
This is a joint paper with Ulrich Volz, Victor Murinde and Sibel Aya. This article presents the first systematic investigation of the effects of climate-related vulnerability on firms’ cost of capital and access to finance. It sheds light on a hitherto underappreciated cost of climate change for climate-vulnerable developing economies. We construct a new climate vulnerability index and use panel instrumental variable regressions to address endogeneity problems.
